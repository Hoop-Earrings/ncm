This Christmas, we've handed out 400 toys to local kids in need. Each child received 3 toys during this event, which was conducted as a drive-thru event in light of Covid-19. As such we sadly were not able to have face painting or Santa present this year but nonetheless we're proud to have helped so many kids have a brighter Christmas.
