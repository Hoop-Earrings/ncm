      <description>This Christmas, we&amp;rsquo;ve handed out 400 toys to local kids in need. Each child received 3 toys during this event, which was conducted as a drive-thru event in light of Covid-19. As such we sadly were not able to have face painting or Santa present this year but nonetheless we&amp;rsquo;re proud to have helped so many kids have a brighter Christmas.</description>

      <description>This Thanksgiving, we handed out 400 meals to the local community. Served by the local community and military personnel, this event was a staggering feat that worked like a well-oiled machine! It&amp;rsquo;s testament to the skill and dedication of our team to serve those in need. Thank you to all who volunteered on this big day!</description>
