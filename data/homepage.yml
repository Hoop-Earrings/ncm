      Through our vision and action, we demonstrate our passion for assisting those in need. We have no zip code restrictions and do not discriminate against anyone in need. All are welcome!

      In November of 2006, as part of our mission to serve the community, we began to fight hunger by gathering and distributing food, engaging in partnerships that advance self-sufficiency and by providing leadership on issues related to hunger.

      Since then we've helped over 5,000,000 people directly and indirectly by supporting other non-profits and community groups.

      Thank you for taking an interest in what we do here at New Challenge Ministries, if you can support us with a donation we would be incredibly grateful, as you can imagine we rely on your generosity to make any of this possible. Thank you!"

John inspires all of us to do all we can and much more by instilling in each of us the notion that feeding the hungry is perhaps the most noble direct gift we can provide. He leads by example and is an extraordinary role model. Moreover, John is responsible and is an effective leader and manager - necessary qualities required in order to organize and delegate to an ever - growing number of volunteers"
